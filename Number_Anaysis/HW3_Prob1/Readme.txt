This program take input from the user on the cooridates, forces on 3 cables,
height of the tower and the maximum value for the overturning moment. 
This program breaks down the cables forces into components. It then find the
resultant vector of all three cables, and then using the <0,0,1> unit
vector for the cell, the program finds the perpendicular vect or its 
magnitude, then the program outputs the overtuning moment magnitude and 
wether or not the restaints are safe for overturning
