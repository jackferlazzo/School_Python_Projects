Sawtooth:
This program accepts the following floating point values as inputs: ampl,
the amplitude of the sawtooth function, period, the period of the sawtooth
function, tMax the upper limit of time for the plot, and tStep the time step.
This program then returns the approximate values of the sawtooth function for each t from
t = 0 to t = tMax in the steps size tStep

Script:
This program accept user input for the floating point values of amplitude, 
period, the upper time limit of the sawtooth function, and the integer value
of capK that indicates the number of terms in the Fourier series you will 
use to approximate the sawtooth function, this code then finds the 
approximate and actual values of the sawtooth function and graphs them both
